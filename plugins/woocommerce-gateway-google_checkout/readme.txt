By Niklas HÃ¶gefjord - http://krokedil.com/
Based on PayPal Standard Gateway by WooCommerce

2. If you use the WordPress plugin uploader to install this plugin skip to step 4.
3. Upload the entire plugin directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Administration.
5. Go WooCommerce Settings --> Payment Gateways and configure your Google Checkout settings.
6. Configure your Google Checkout merchant account as follows (you can find this under --> Settings --> Integration):
